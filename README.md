# Gekko-Strategies
Repository of strategies which I found at Git and Google. All strategies was backtested, result is in directory of each strategy.

gekko-auto-backtest.pl - my script which doing backtests on multiple strategies and/or multiple coin pairs. Copy it to Gekko directory, and set @strategies, @pairs and candleSize. Running by perl gekko-auto-backtest.pl. Datasets of pairs must be imported to Gekko via command or UI.
